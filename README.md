# Exploring COVID-19 Trends in Mexico during the Winter Season with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)

Code related to the article Exploring COVID-19 Trends in Mexico during the Winter Season with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) from IEEE Latin America Transactions.

## Model Interpretability with SHAP and Interpret

Please consult the SHAP API at https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a tool for explaining the output of machine learning models. It assigns each feature an important value for a particular prediction, helping to clarify how the model works internally and contributing to more transparent and interpretable machine learning processes.

## Dataset

The dataset titled "Covid19MexInv2021-2022EDOS.csv," which encompasses reported cases from Mexico City and the State of Mexico during the winter period of 2021-2022, was derived and previously processed. The source of this dataset is the official website of the Mexican government's health department, accessible at https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/datos-abiertos-152127.

### Installation

Make sure you've installed the `shap` and `interpret` libraries:

```bash
pip install shap
pip install interpret
